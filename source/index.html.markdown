# LECTURE

I've been doing some light research on trying to find people
that overtly attack social media, social media structuring,
online media deployment.  Finding figures that hold this as a
foundational talking point has not been easy... even taking to
wikipedia (which often is a great resource for finding more
in-depth resources for study), most of the figures I came across
(People outspoken on the topic) were somewhat schlocky, and
were aiming at selling some kind of book or personality based
on the audacity of some maxim or set of maxims

(i.e.Social Media is Bullshit)

Digital Humanities:

When we move this talk about old media vs new media in an academic
context, I'm most familiar/involved with the debates surrounding
digital humanities.  If you aren't familiar there is a great book
(however EXTREMELY long) written by Matt Gold at The Graduate
Center [DEBATES IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates)
